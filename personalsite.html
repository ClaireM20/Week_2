<h1>Why I wanted to start coding with Code Nation</h1>

  

<p> 
I was very interested in learning to code because I had been using drag and drop software for years building
websites for other people and for myself. This wasn't satisfactory in terms of manipulation and control of the end 
result of the sites. Code Nation is a Manchester based company which is where I am from and during my research on 
coding camps their reputation was easily one of the best.

I need to revise the content from week one in order to consolidate my understanding of the topics covered. I have picked up
quite a bit. Given that I had zero prior experience of Javascript I am pleased with the knowledge that I have acquired from a 
standing start. However, I do need lots more practise.I aim to go through the slides again and work through the tasks one by 
one until I am confident with them and can work independently on them.
